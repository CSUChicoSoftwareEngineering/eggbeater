Hey guys, I have started working on the packet functions and have posted them here. I haven't been able to test or compile them using the makefile because i am missing some of the includes.
However, I could use some help. Never got a chance to meet with Sam W on this so I will try to schedule with him.

What are all the commandtypes that we will need?
-I have some in the packet.cpp
